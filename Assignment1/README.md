# Compile the code
In your terminal, type:

gcc sh.c

If your computer (assuming Mac) does not have GNU, install Homebrew by pasting and running this script in your Terminal:

/usr/bin/ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)"

Enter your system password and wait for the installation to finish. Once it's done, you can now compile using gcc command.
